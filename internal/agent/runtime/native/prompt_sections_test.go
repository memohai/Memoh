Valid layers are:\n\n`preference`, `identity`, `context`, `experience`, `activity`, `persona`, `note`.\n\nEach concept file must use document-level YAML front matter:\n\n```\n---\ntype: memory\ntitle: User prefers oolong tea\nid: mem_20260313_001\nlayer: preference\ntags:\n  - tea\nconfidence: 0.8\nprofile_ref: user:example\ntimestamp: 2026-03-13T13:34:49Z\nupdated_at: 2026-03-13T13:34:49Z\nmetadata:\n  topic: tea\n---\n\nThe user prefers oolong tea.\n```\n\nRules:\n- Only write NEW durable memory items. Do not rewrite old content unless you are correcting or consolidating it.\n- Choose a stable lowercase slug for the filename, for example `memory/preference/user-prefers-oolong-tea.md`.\n- The `id` MUST be stable and deterministic. When you update or rewrite an existing concept, REUSE its `id` so the backend updates the same record instead of creating a duplicate. A good pattern is `mem_<yyyymmdd>_<shortslug>` (e.g. `mem_20260313_userprefersoolong`). Never mint a fresh id for the same concept.\n- Use `type` for the fact kind, `tags` for topics, and `timestamp` for when the memory was captured. Update `updated_at` whenever you revise a file, so recency reflects real edits.\n- Make `tags` specific and discriminating (e.g. `query-behavior`, `first-interaction`, `beverage-preference`), not generic buckets (`user`, `preference`) that apply to almost every memory.\n- The body must carry real content beyond the title/frontmatter. Record context, evidence, or source — for example \"User asked which tools are available in the first turn, then probed each tool's capabilities.\" A body that merely restates the title adds no recall value.\n- When a memory is about a known user or group from `PROFILES.md`, include a stable profile link in `metadata` (for example `profile_ref`, plus identity fields when available).\n- Use `[[slug]]` or relative links such as `[Tea Stack](../context/tea-stack.md)` to connect related concept files. Keep references directional and acyclic — point from specifics to broader concepts (e.g. an experience → the preference it reveals), and avoid A↔B mutual links, which flatten the graph and erase semantic distance.\n- Do not provide `hash`; the backend generates it.\n- If plain text is unavoidable, write concise factual notes only.\n- `MEMORY.md` stays a human-readable index. Do not turn it into JSON.\n\n## Platform Identities\n\n<identity channel=\"telegram\" username=\"@memoh\"/>\n\n## Skills\n\nMemoh-managed skills are stored in `/data/skills/`.

These files are your continuity:\n\n- **Memory bundle:** `memory/<layer>/<slug>.md` — one concept per file, grouped by layer\n- **Overview:** `MEMORY.md` — the human-readable index for the bundle\n\n### Memory Write Rules\n\nUse one concept file per durable memory. Valid layers are:\n\n`preference`, `identity`, `context`, `experience`, `activity`, `persona`, `note`.\n\nEach concept file must use document-level YAML front matter:\n\n```\n---\ntype: memory\ntitle: User prefers oolong tea\nid: mem_20260313_001\nlayer: preference\ntags:\n  - tea\nconfidence: 0.8\nprofile_ref: user:example\ntimestamp: 2026-03-13T13:34:49Z\nupdated_at: 2026-03-13T13:34:49Z\nmetadata:\n  topic: tea\n---\n\nThe user prefers oolong tea.\n```\n\nRules:\n- Only write NEW durable memory items. Do not rewrite old content unless you are correcting or consolidating it.\n- Choose a stable lowercase slug for the filename, for example `memory/preference/user-prefers-oolong-tea.md`.\n- The `id` MUST be stable and deterministic. When you update or rewrite an existing concept, REUSE its `id` so the backend updates the same record instead of creating a duplicate. A good pattern is `mem_<yyyymmdd>_<shortslug>` (e.g. `mem_20260313_userprefersoolong`). Never mint a fresh id for the same concept.\n- Use `type` for the fact kind, `tags` for topics, and `timestamp` for when the memory was captured. Update `updated_at` whenever you revise a file, so recency reflects real edits.\n- Make `tags` specific and discriminating (e.g. `query-behavior`, `first-interaction`, `beverage-preference`), not generic buckets (`user`, `preference`) that apply to almost every memory.\n- The body must carry real content beyond the title/frontmatter. Record context, evidence, or source — for example \"User asked which tools are available in the first turn, then probed each tool's capabilities.\" A body that merely restates the title adds no recall value.\n- When a memory is about a known user or group from `PROFILES.md`, include a stable profile link in `metadata` (for example `profile_ref`, plus identity fields when available).\n- Use `[[slug]]` or relative links such as `[Tea Stack](../context/tea-stack.md)` to connect related concept files. Keep references directional and acyclic — point from specifics to broader concepts (e.g. an experience → the preference it reveals), and avoid A↔B mutual links, which flatten the graph and erase semantic distance.\n- Do not provide `hash`; the backend generates it.\n- If plain text is unavoidable, write concise factual notes only.\n- `MEMORY.md` stays a human-readable index. Do not turn it into JSON."
